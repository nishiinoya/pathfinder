# Pathfinder  | Shortest Path Utility

## Description

The goal of this challenge is to develop an algorithm that finds the shortest paths between points. Finding optimal paths is a significant problem with practical applications, including:

- Navigating cities using GPS while considering traffic congestion.
- Optimizing routes for deliveries or business trips.
- Managing data packet routing in networks.

Every day, individuals face decisions that require efficient pathfinding—balancing work, appointments, hobbies, and social events. Automating these decisions helps save time and make life easier.



## Algorithm Used: Dijkstra's Algorithm

### What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?

Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic algorithm in computer science for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It is widely used in applications like navigation systems, network routing, and resource optimization.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start from the source node and assign it a tentative distance of `0`.
   - Set all other nodes' distances to infinity (`∞`).
   - Keep track of unvisited nodes and the shortest paths found.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance.
   - Update the distances of its neighboring nodes by checking if a shorter path exists through the current node.
   - Mark the current node as visited.

3. **Repeat**:
   - Continue until all nodes are visited or the target node's shortest distance is found.

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Trace back from the target node to the source node to construct the shortest path.

### Why Dijkstra for This Task?

Dijkstra's algorithm was chosen because:
- **Efficiency**: It finds the shortest path in weighted graphs efficiently for smaller datasets.
- **Simplicity**: It is easy to implement and understand, making it a suitable choice for this individual challenge.
- **Real-world Applicability**: It mirrors real-world use cases like navigation and scheduling.

### Implementation in the Pathfinder Challenge

In this task:
1. **Inputs**: A graph with points (nodes) and weighted connections (edges representing distances).
2. **Outputs**: The shortest path from a starting point to one or more destination points. 
3. **Enhancements**: The implementation supports:
   - Error handling.
   - Reconstructing the shortest path for visualization.
